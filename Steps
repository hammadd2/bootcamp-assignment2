	****************************   
	React Installation and Surge
	****************************
- Steps:
1) Create React Application
2) REact application does't understand Browser so needs to convert into javascript
3) Files are too many, so requires "build" to compact files, and will helps to provide only required files
4) Consider Concise files, so we use "build" either through yarn or npm. These javascript files will run on browser	 
5) Keep source-code on Github	
6) Git Actions Build
